# Executing a Work Plan

## Overview

This skill orchestrates the execution of work plans created by `building-a-work-plan`. It processes milestones sequentially, dispatching `code-worker` agents for each task, conducting code review after each task, and fixing all issues before proceeding to the next task. The goal is complete, reviewed implementation — not just "code that works."

## Key Principles

### Human Transparency

**After every agent completes, print their full response before taking further action.**

The human cannot see subagent outputs directly. You are their window into the work. Show all details:
- Test counts and results
- Issue lists with locations (file:line for EVERY issue)
- Commit hashes
- Error messages
- Verification evidence

**Never summarize agent output. Print it completely.**

**For code reviews specifically**: Print the ENTIRE structured report including:
- Status (APPROVED/BLOCKED)
- Issue Summary counts
- Verification Evidence (actual command outputs)
- Every issue with Location, Issue, Impact, Fix
- Decision

Do NOT write: "The code review found 2 Important issues..."
DO write: [paste the full markdown report from the code-reviewer]

### Just-in-Time Loading

**Never load all milestones upfront.**

Read one milestone, execute all its tasks, review, then move to the next. This preserves context within token budgets. If you read everything at once, you'll run out of context before finishing.

### Per-Task Review

**Review after every task completion, not at milestone end.**

Per-task review catches issues early before they compound. If a task introduces a bug, the next task may build on that bug, making it harder to fix. Review immediately, fix immediately, then proceed.

## When to Use

- After `building-a-work-plan` creates a work plan
- When work plan files exist at `docs/work-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-[plan-name]/`
- When ready to implement (not just plan)

## When NOT to Use

- No work plan exists yet (use `building-a-work-plan` first)
- Work plan needs revision (fix the plan first)
- Single-file fixes that don't need orchestration

## Entry Point

When the user invokes `/execute-work-plan`:

1. **Announce**: "I'm using the executing-a-work-plan skill to implement your work plan."

2. **Get work plan path**:
   - If user provided a path, use it
   - If not, use `AskUserQuestion` to request the path
   - **Never guess the path**

3. **Verify prerequisites**:
   - Work plan directory exists
   - Contains `milestone_##.md` files
   - Working directory is a git repository

4. **Create orchestration tasks** (see Task Tracking)

5. **Execute milestones**

## Task Tracking

Create tasks at session start. Update status as you progress.

```
◻ #1 Discover: List milestones without reading full content
◻ #2 Execute Milestone 1: [title from header]
   ◻ Task 1.1: [task title] → Review → Fix
   ◻ Task 1.2: [task title] → Review → Fix
   ...
   ◻ Milestone 1 Review: Cross-task integration check
◻ #3 Execute Milestone 2: [title]
   ◻ Task 2.1: [task title] → Review → Fix
   ...
   ◻ Milestone 2 Review: Cross-task integration check
... (repeat for each milestone)
◻ #N Final Review: Full implementation review
◻ #N+1 Complete: Summary and handoff
```

Each task follows: Implement → Review → Fix → Next Task.
Each milestone ends with: Milestone Review → Fix cross-task issues → Next Milestone.

Use `TaskCreate` and `TaskUpdate` to manage these.

## Core Pattern

### Step 1: Discover Milestones

List milestone files without reading full content:

```bash
ls docs/work-plans/[plan-name]/milestone_*.md
```

Extract headers to get titles and task counts:

```bash
head -20 docs/work-plans/[plan-name]/milestone_01.md
```

Create the task list based on discovered milestones.

### Step 2: Execute Each Milestone

For each milestone M:

#### 2a. Read Milestone (Just-in-Time)

Mark task as `in_progress`. Read only that milestone file:

```bash
cat docs/work-plans/[plan-name]/milestone_0M.md
```

Extract:
- Milestone title and goal
- List of tasks with their types
- Task dependencies (Blocked By / Blocks)

#### 2b. Verify Test Coverage in Plan

Before dispatching any task:

**For Functionality and Integration tasks**, verify the plan includes test specifications. If tests are missing from the plan, stop and report:

```
Plan gap detected: Task M.X ([title]) is type Functionality but has no test specification.
Cannot implement without tests. Please update the work plan.
```

Do not implement functionality without tests specified in the plan.

#### 2c. Execute Task with Review

For each task in the milestone, follow this cycle:

**Step 1: Check dependencies**

If blocked by incomplete tasks, skip and note.

**Step 2: Dispatch `code-worker` agent**

```
Implement this task from the work plan:

Milestone file: [absolute path]
Task: [task number and title]

The task specification is in the milestone file. Read it, implement it following TDD,
run verification, update the work plan file, and commit.

Report back with your completion report.
```

**Step 3: Print the full agent response.** Do not summarize.

**Step 4: Code review this task**

Immediately after the task completes:

1. **Capture git state**:
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # Before this task's commit
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)     # After this task's commit
```

2. **Use `requesting-code-review` skill**:
   - Provide what was implemented (this task only)
   - Reference the milestone file and task number
   - Include base and head commit SHAs

3. **Handle review results**:
   - **Zero issues**: Record completion, proceed to next task
   - **Any issues**: Dispatch `bug-worker` agent to fix ALL issues (Critical, Important, Minor)

4. **Print full review and fix responses.**

5. **Re-review after fixes.** Loop until zero issues for this task.

**Step 5: Record completion**

Note task number, commit SHA, review cycles needed.

**Step 6: Proceed to next task**

Only after this task passes review with zero issues.

#### 2d. Three-Strike Rule (Per Task)

If the same issue persists after three review cycles for a single task:

```
ESCALATION REQUIRED

Task: [task number and title]
Issue "[issue title]" has persisted through 3 review cycles.

Location: [file:line]
Issue: [description]
Attempted fixes:
  Cycle 1: [what was tried]
  Cycle 2: [what was tried]
  Cycle 3: [what was tried]

This requires human intervention. Please review and advise.
```

Stop and wait for human guidance. Do not continue to next task.

#### 2e. Milestone Completion Review

After all tasks in the milestone pass their individual reviews:

1. **Run milestone-level review** covering all tasks together:
   - Use `requesting-code-review` skill
   - Reference the full milestone (not individual task)
   - Include commit range from milestone start to end

2. **This catches cross-task issues** that individual task reviews might miss:
   - Integration problems between tasks
   - Inconsistent patterns across tasks
   - Missing edge cases at boundaries

3. **Handle review results** same as task review:
   - Zero issues: Mark milestone complete
   - Any issues: Fix with `bug-worker`, re-review

#### 2f. Proceed to Next Milestone

After milestone completion review passes, mark milestone complete. Move to next milestone's read step.

### Step 3: Final Review

After all milestones are complete:

1. **Run full implementation review** using `requesting-code-review` skill
2. **Fix any remaining issues** with `bug-worker`
3. **Loop until zero issues**

### Step 4: Complete

Provide completion report:

```markdown
## Work Plan Execution Complete

### Summary

| Milestone | Tasks | Review Cycles | Status |
|-----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| M1: [title] | N | X | Complete |
| M2: [title] | N | X | Complete |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Total tasks implemented**: [count]
**Total review cycles**: [count]
**Escalations**: [count or "None"]

### Commits

[List of commit SHAs with messages]

### Files Changed

[Summary of files created/modified]

### Verification Evidence

- Tests: [final test count and status]
- Linter: [status]
- Type checker: [status]

### Next Steps

The implementation is complete and reviewed. Consider:
1. Manual testing of the full feature
2. Creating a PR for review
3. Updating documentation if needed
```

## Resumption

If interrupted mid-execution:

1. Ask for the work plan directory path
2. Read milestone files to determine progress (look for ✓ markers)
3. Identify which milestone/task is next
4. Resume from that point

## Integration with Agents

| Agent | Role | When Dispatched |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `code-worker` | Implements individual tasks | For each task in a milestone |
| `code-reviewer` | Reviews completed work | After each task AND after milestone completion |
| `bug-worker` | Fixes review issues | When any review finds issues |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Reading all milestones upfront | Exhausts context | Just-in-time loading |
| Skipping per-task review | Bugs compound across tasks | Review after EVERY task |
| Skipping milestone review | Cross-task issues missed | Also review at milestone end |
| Summarizing agent output | Human can't see what happened | Print full responses |
| Skipping functionality tests | Untested code ships bugs | Verify plan includes tests |
| Continuing after 3 strikes | Infinite loop on unfixable issues | Escalate to human |
| Guessing work plan path | Wrong plan, wasted effort | Always ask if not provided |

## Anti-Rationalizations

- "I'll read all milestones to understand the full scope" — No. Context limits are real. Read just-in-time.
- "I remember what the milestone said" — No. Always read just-in-time. Memory drifts.
- "I'll batch the reviews to save tokens" — No. Per-task review catches bugs before they compound. Fix early.
- "The task review passed, skip milestone review" — No. Milestone review catches cross-task integration issues.
- "The agent response is too long, I'll summarize" — No. Human transparency requires full output.
- "I'll just say how many issues were found" — No. Print every issue with Location, Issue, Impact, Fix. The user needs details to understand what's happening.
- "Minor issues can wait until the end" — No. Fix ALL issues including Minor before proceeding.
- "Three cycles should be enough, I'll try once more" — No. Three strikes means escalate.

## Summary

1. **Just-in-time loading.** Read one milestone at a time.
2. **Print full agent responses.** Human transparency is non-negotiable.
3. **Per-task review.** Review after every task completion.
4. **Milestone completion review.** Also review at milestone end for cross-task issues.
5. **Fix ALL issues.** Critical, Important, AND Minor.
6. **Three-strike rule.** Escalate persistent issues to human.
7. **Track progress with tasks.** Survive interruptions.

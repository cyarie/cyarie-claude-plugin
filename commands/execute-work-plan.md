**Coming soon**: This command will execute a work plan created by `/build-work-plan`.

For now, implement tasks manually:
1. Open the milestone files in `docs/work-plans/<plan-name>/`
2. Follow the TDD workflow in each task
3. Mark tasks complete as you go

The execution skill will automate this process when available.
